(Alex) I used g++ to compile my work. In case you do as well, you have to include all cpp files that are included in your main.cpp file into your g++ argument.
(Alex) In case you do the same: Do not define your classes twice! Only once in the .h file will suffice.
(Alex) My work has not been compiled yet. I have errors with the preprocessor macros (#ifdef, #define, #endif), so my code does not compiled because class definitions have been defined more than once. I sent an email to the teacher. Awaiting an answer...
