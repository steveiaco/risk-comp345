# risk-comp345
COMP345 Semester project

Please do not modify the master branch directly.

When you want to add your part to the project, create a sub-branch to the test branch with your part. 
Test it to make sure everything is fine.

The test branch will serve as a master branch. This is where you will be able to test the parts of everyone being put together.

If the test branch is working fine and has been tested, then it can be merged with the master branch.
